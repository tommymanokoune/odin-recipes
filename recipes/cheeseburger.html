    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cheeseburgers are one of my favorite dishes, and I'm excited to share it with you
    </p>
    <p>
      A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>600 g / 1.2 lb beef mince (ground beef) , at least 20% fat (Note 1 for quality)</li>
        <li>1.2 kg / 2.4 lb beef mince (ground beef) , at least 20% fat (Note 1 for quality)</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp each salt and pepper PER burger</li>
        <li>2 – 3 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>4 soft burger buns or rolls , around 10cm/4″ wide (Note 2)</li>
        <li>4 – 8 slices burger cheese (American) or other cheese or choice (Note 3)</li>
        <li>8 cos/romaine lettuce leaves , torn to size (or shredded iceberg)</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes , cut into eight 7mm/ 1/4" slices</li>
        <li>1 red onion , finely sliced into rings (Note 4)</li>
        <li>2 large gherkins , finely sliced (Note 5)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Patties: Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).</li>
        <li>Prepare: Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).</li>
        <li>Toast buns: Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dent patty: Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Stove</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot – smoking hot! (Note 6) </li>
        <li>Cook: Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble:</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack. </li>
    </ol>
